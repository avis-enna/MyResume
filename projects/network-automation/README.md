# Network Automation Toolkit 🔧

A production-grade enterprise network automation platform engineered for Cisco infrastructure with advanced device management, configuration automation, and real-time monitoring capabilities.

## 🎯 Enhanced Features (Jan 2025)

### Core Automation Engine
- **Intelligent Device Discovery**: Multi-threaded SNMP v2c/v3 scanning with CDP neighbor detection
- **Configuration Lifecycle Management**: Version-controlled backup with automated diff analysis
- **Enterprise Bulk Deployment**: Jinja2-powered template engine with variable validation
- **Real-time Health Monitoring**: SNMP-based performance metrics with alerting
- **Security Compliance Auditing**: Policy-based configuration validation and reporting

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Multi-Vendor Support**: Cisco IOS/NX-OS, Juniper JunOS, Arista EOS compatibility
- **API-First Architecture**: RESTful API with comprehensive authentication and rate limiting
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates for deployment status and device health
- **Rollback Mechanisms**: Automated configuration rollback on deployment failures
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging with tamper-proof audit trails

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Backend Infrastructure
- **Python 3.11+** with asyncio for concurrent operations
- **NETCONF/YANG** for standardized device communication
- **SNMP v2c/v3** for device discovery and monitoring
- **SSH/Telnet** with advanced connection pooling
- **Flask 2.3+** with Blueprint architecture
- **SQLAlchemy** with PostgreSQL for production deployments
- **Redis** for session management and task queuing

### Security & Compliance
- **OAuth 2.0** authentication with role-based access control
- **TLS 1.3** encryption for all communications
- **Vault Integration** for credential management
- **SOC 2 Type II** compliance framework
