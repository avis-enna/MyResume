# Fixes Applied to InteractiveTerminal.tsx

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Input Focus Problem
- **Problem**: Input lost focus when clicking anywhere and didn't restore properly
- **Fix**: 
  - Added global click handler to restore focus when clicking outside floating windows
  - Improved `handleTerminalClick` to detect floating windows and avoid focus conflicts
  - Added timeout-based focus restoration in onBlur event
  - Added interval-based focus check to ensure input is always focusable

### 2. Scroll Up Not Working
- **Problem**: Auto-scroll was overriding manual scrolling
- **Fix**:
  - Enhanced scroll logic to only auto-scroll when user is near bottom (within 100px)
  - Used `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother scrolling
  - Preserved manual scroll position when user scrolls up

### 3. Open Command Not Working
- **Problem**: Windows said "opened successfully" but didn't appear
- **Fix**:
  - Added better debugging with console logs
  - Added debug panel (top-right corner) to show window states
  - Enhanced `openSection` function to properly set zIndex
  - Improved initial window positions to ensure visibility
  - Added better error handling and state management

### 4. Additional Improvements
- **Window Management**:
  - Added `floating-window` class for better element detection
  - Improved z-index management (1000+ base with proper increments)
  - Enhanced window positioning and animation
  - Better Mac-style window controls

- **Performance**:
  - Optimized animation timings
  - Simplified framer-motion transitions
  - Better state management for window operations

  - More responsive input handling
